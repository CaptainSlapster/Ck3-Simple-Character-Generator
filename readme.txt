Hello, This is a simple command line esque character generator for CK3. This unfortunately doesn't produce dynasties. It is useful for creating counts/dukes.

To use this tool:

    1.  Create a text file with the same formatting as the included names.txt file (You do not need to name it names.txt).

    2.  Drag and drop the text file onto to application.

    3.  Follow the included prompts and it will generate the characters you want!

    4.  If done correctly it will produce an output.txt file that will contain your characters with the following format:

    roman_0 = {
        name = "Flacilla"
    
        religion = catholic
        culture = roman
        female = yes
        468.7.3 ={
            birth = yes
        }
        541.7.1 = {
            death = yes
        }
    
    }
     
    roman_1 = {
        name = "Sextus"
    
        religion = catholic
        culture = roman
    
        411.11.27 ={
            birth = yes
        }
        595.9.4 = {
            death = yes
        }
    }
