##Will need to figure out a good way to do this
##Dynasty creation code we'll see how it works##

#               X---X Gen 1
#             X--X X--X Gen 2
#           X-X X-X X-X X-X Gen 3
#
# Dynasties will be classes in order to make creating/adjusting easier
# Using a separate character creator for now to get it functional.

#import random
